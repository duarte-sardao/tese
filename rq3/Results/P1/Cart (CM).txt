        user.balance -= cost;
        cartItems.clear();
    }
}
Please infer the intention of the "checkout(String)"

Completion:

The intention of the "checkout(String)" method in the Cart class is to process the checkout of the items in the cart for a specific user with a given discount code. The method calculates the total cost of the items in the cart after applying the discount specified by the code, subtracts this cost from the user's balance, and then clears the cart items. If the cost after applying the discount is 0, it will throw a RuntimeException indicating that the cost cannot be 0.

You are a professional who writes Java test methods. Please write a test method for the "checkout(String)" with the given Method intention.

Completion 2:

Sure, here is a test method for the "checkout(String)" method in the Cart class:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class CartTest {

    @Test
    void testCheckout_withValidDiscountCode() {
        User user = new User("John", 100.0);
        Cart cart = new Cart(user);
        Item item1 = new Item("Product1", 10.0);
        Item item2 = new Item("Product2", 20.0);
        cart.add_item(item1);
        cart.add_item(item2);

        cart.checkout("loyal");

        // Check user's balance after checkout
        assertEquals(69.0, user.balance);

        // Check cart is cleared after checkout
        assertTrue(cart.cartItems.isEmpty());
    }

    @Test
    void testCheckout_withZeroCostAfterDiscountCode() {
        User user = new User("Jane", 50.0);
        Cart cart = new Cart(user);
        Item item = new Item("Product", 40.0);
        cart.add_item(item);

        RuntimeException exception = assertThrows(RuntimeException.class, () -> {
            cart.checkout("superpromo");
        });

        assertEquals("Cost can't be 0", exception.getMessage());

        // Check user's balance is unchanged
        assertEquals(50.0, user.balance);

        // Check cart is not cleared
        assertFalse(cart.cartItems.isEmpty());
    }
}
```

In this test class, we have two test methods. The first one tests the checkout process with a valid discount code "loyal" where the cost is deducted from the user's balance and the cart is cleared. The second test method tests the scenario where the cost after applying the discount is 0, and it verifies that a RuntimeException is thrown, the user's balance remains unchanged, and the cart is not cleared.
