\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my thesis coordinators, José Campos and Antónia Lopes, for their continuous support and invaluable guidance.
Their insights and advice in our regular meetings were instrumental, providing me with clear goals and targets, and I am deeply appreciative of their contributions.

I would also like to deeply thank my family, whose support and encouragement has been a constant source of strength throughoutmy entire academic journey. 
It was because of their love, education and support that I reached this milestone.

A special acknowledgment goes to Aalto University and the country of Finland, where I had the privilege to spend my first semester of this academic year.
My experience there, concurrently with the beginning of my work on this thesis, broadened my academic and personal experience.

Lastly, I would like to thank my friends who were there throughout this process.
Particularly I'd like to thank Ignasi, who accompanied me in Finland and in a vacation in March,
which gave me motivation to keep working and renewed my energies.
